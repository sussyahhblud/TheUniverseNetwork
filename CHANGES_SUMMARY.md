# ✅ Recent Changes - The Universe Network

## Changes Completed (Latest Session)

### 1. ✅ Created Games Listing Page
**File:** `games/index.html` (NEW)

- Created a beautiful games listing page at `/games/`
- All 5 games displayed in a responsive grid layout
- Each game card shows:
  - **Actual game icon** from the icons folder
  - Game title
  - Short description
  - Clickable link to the game

**Games Listed:**
- Cookie Clicker → `/games/cookie-clicker/`
- Crossy Road → `/games/crossyroad/`
- Minecraft → `/games/minecraft/`
- Slope → `/games/slope/`
- Super Mario 64 → `/games/super-mario-64/`

### 2. ✅ Updated All Game Icons
**Icons Used (from icons folder):**
- `unnamed_1761182690950.png` → Cookie Clicker
- `unnamed (1)_1761182690949.png` → Crossy Road
- `minecraft-1639513933156_1761182690949.webp` → Minecraft
- `slope-logo-1-f309x309_1761182690950.webp` → Slope
- `5276953_1761182690950.png` → Super Mario 64

**Updated in:**
- ✅ `index.html` (home page game download modal)
- ✅ `games/index.html` (games listing page)

### 3. ✅ Removed Cookie Clicker Download Popup
**What Was Removed:**

- Removed the `/api/download-images` endpoint from `server.py`
- Removed the `handle_download_images()` function (70+ lines)
- This popup is no longer needed because all game files are downloaded together via the main download system

**Why This Was Removed:**

The original system had a separate download popup specifically for Cookie Clicker images that would appear when clicking the game card. Since all games (including Cookie Clicker) are now downloaded together via the main download button, this separate popup was redundant and confusing.

### 4. ✅ Updated Documentation
**Files Updated:**
- `replit.md` - Updated recent changes section
- `README.md` - Updated project structure
- Both files now accurately reflect:
  - Games listing page exists
  - Icons are used from the icons folder
  - Cookie Clicker download popup has been removed
  - All games download together

## Visual Changes

### Before:
- No games listing page (showed directory listing)
- Emojis used for game icons on home page
- Separate Cookie Clicker download popup

### After:
- ✅ Professional games listing page at `/games/`
- ✅ Actual game icon images used throughout
- ✅ Streamlined download process (all games at once)
- ✅ Consistent visual design

## Testing

Navigate to:
- **Home:** `http://localhost:5000/` - Shows modal with game icons
- **Games:** `http://localhost:5000/games/` - Shows all 5 games with proper icons
- **Each game:** Click any game card to navigate to that game
