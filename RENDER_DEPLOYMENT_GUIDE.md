# üöÄ Render Deployment Guide for The Universe Network

## Current Issue

Your site is currently deployed as a **Static Site** on Render.com, but The Universe Network requires a **Web Service** deployment to download and extract game files.

### Why Static Sites Don't Work

- **Static sites** only serve pre-built HTML/CSS/JS files - no server-side code execution
- **Your site needs** Python backend to download the 41.5MB game zip file and extract it
- The Python server (`server.py`) provides API endpoints (`/api/download-games`) that can't run on static hosting

## ‚úÖ Solution: Switch to Web Service

Follow these steps to enable game downloads:

### Step 1: Access Your Render Dashboard
Go to [https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)

### Step 2: Remove Current Static Site
1. Find your current "theuniversenetwork" static site
2. Click on it
3. Go to **Settings** (bottom of left sidebar)
4. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
5. Click **Delete Static Site**
6. Confirm deletion

### Step 3: Create New Web Service
1. Click **New +** button (top right)
2. Select **Web Service**
3. Connect your GitHub repository (if not already connected)
4. Select the repository for The Universe Network

### Step 4: Configure Web Service
Fill in these settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Name** | `theuniversenetwork` (or your preferred name) |
| **Environment** | `Python 3` |
| **Region** | Choose closest to your users |
| **Branch** | `main` (or your default branch) |
| **Build Command** | Leave empty (no build needed) |
| **Start Command** | `python3 server.py` |
| **Instance Type** | `Free` (or paid if you prefer) |

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click **Create Web Service**
2. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
3. Once deployed, visit your new `.onrender.com` URL
4. Click **Download Games** button - it will now work! üéÆ

## What This Changes

### ‚úÖ With Web Service (New Setup)
- ‚úÖ Game download button works
- ‚úÖ Downloads 41.5MB zip file from Dropbox
- ‚úÖ Automatically extracts all 5 games
- ‚úÖ Games become playable immediately
- ‚úÖ Same URL structure and features

### ‚ùå With Static Site (Current Setup)
- ‚ùå No Python backend available
- ‚ùå Cannot download or extract files
- ‚ùå Shows error: "Backend Required"
- ‚ùå Games don't work

## Alternative Options

If you prefer to keep static hosting, you would need to:
1. Pre-download all game files
2. Include them in your GitHub repository
3. Push them with your code

**However**, this is not recommended because:
- Game files are ~50MB+ total
- GitHub has repository size limits
- Slower git operations
- Unnecessary repository bloat

## Cost Information

**Render Free Tier:**
- Web Services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Wake up when someone visits (adds ~30 second delay on first visit)
- 750 hours/month free (sufficient for most personal projects)

**Render Paid Tier ($7/month):**
- Always-on service (no sleep)
- Instant response times
- Better for production sites

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check that `server.py` is in your repository root
2. Verify the Start Command is exactly: `python3 server.py`
3. Ensure Environment is set to "Python 3"
4. Check deployment logs in Render dashboard
